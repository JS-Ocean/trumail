Trumail is a free and open source email validation/verification system. It is available in three forms, the Golang client library `verifier` for use in your own Go projects, a public API endpoint (more info: https://trumail.io), and a public Docker image on DockerHub (see: https://hub.docker.com/r/sdwolfe32/trumail/). 

Our own API endpoint allows up to 1RPS per IP. This is to prevent abuse and to leave the tubes open for other users. If you perform requests in excess of the specified rate-limit a `429 Too Many Requests` will be returned instead.

NOTE: It is highly recommended (due to potential heroku IP blacklisting resulting in failed validations) that you host the service yourself either using a Docker image or by forking and serving this project on your own instance. However, self-hosting Trumail requires bidirectional communication on port 25 which most residential ISPs restrict. AWS and Digitalocean both allow this.

## Using the API (public or self-hosted)

Using the API is very simple. All that's needed to validate an address is to send a `GET` request using the below URL with one of our two supported formats (json/xml).
```
trumail.io/{format}/{email}
```

## Running with Docker

```
$ docker run sdwolfe32/trumail
```

## Using the library

```
package main

import (
	"log"

	trumail "github.com/sdwolfe32/trumail/verifier"
)

func main() {
	v := trumail.NewVerifier(20, "YOUR_HOSTNAME.COM", "YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM")
	res := v.Verify("test@gmail.com")
	log.Println(*res[0])
}
```

## Running with Docker

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e SOURCE_ADDR=my.email@gmail.com sdwolfe32/trumail
```
